        Tesla’s annual cost of sales has been gradually increasing each year, a
        trend that aligns with the rising numbers of vehicles sold. In first
        quarter of the current financial year, cost of sales amounting to
        $17,605 million. This amount represents a decrease
        <strong>of 15,07%</strong> from the previous quarter, and
        <strong>6,45% decrease</strong>
        compared to 2023’s first quarter. However, there was an
        <strong>increase of 18,84%</strong>
        in the second quarter, which is a
        <strong>rise of 2.93%</strong> compared to the same period last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2><strong>Factors Impacting Cost of Sales</strong></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Lithium forms part of one of the most crucial components of electrical
        vehicles (EVs). Prices for lithium reached an all-time high in 2020 due
        to its high demand for EVs, which led to increased cost of sales and
        lower gross profit margins. However, prices started declining from 2023
        onwards due to a decline in sales growth. The drop in lithium prices
        positively impacted Tesla’s cost of sales, as it resulted in a reduction
        in raw material cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tesla’s vehicles also rely on other key materials, including steel,
        nickel, aluminium and lithium cells. The prices of these elements are
        volatile, and even minor price changes can significantly affect the cost
        of manufacturing electric vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, vehicle recalls have may have contributed to the increase
        in Tesla’s cost of sales. Approximately 2.2 million vehicles have been
        recalled by Tesla during the first quarter of 2024, and over 2 million
        vehicles were recalled during the fourth quarter of 2023.The costs
        associated with repairing or replacing the recalled parts are typically
        absorbed by the company, which negatively impacting cost of sales.

      <h2><u>Cost reduction strategies</u></h2>
      <p>
        In an attempt to reduce cost of production and improve the gross profit
        margin, Tesla has implemented the following strategies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Switching from LCO (Lithium-Cobalt-Oxide) to LFP (Lithium-Iron
          Phosphate) batteries
          <ul>
            <li>
              LCO batteries contained Cobalt, a rare and expensive mineral
              element to obtain. Transitioning from LCO to LFP batteries reduced
              the cost of raw materials significantly, as the cobalt was
              replaced with lithium, which is a cheaper alternative and easier
              to recycle.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Introducing in-house components
          <ul>
            <li>
              Telsa designed the Gigafactory with the aim to produce its own
              lithium-ion batteries. This strategy allows Tesla to be less
              reliant on external suppliers for the production batteries and
              made it possible to reduce cell cost much faster that the status
              quo.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Improving manufacturing techniques
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tesla started using large casting machines and automated
              production lines to enhance manufacturing efficiency and lower
              costs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong><u>Financial Summary</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tesla’s annual cost of sales has been gradually increasing each year, a
        trend that aligns with the rising numbers of vehicles sold. In first
        quarter of the current financial year, cost of sales amounting to
        $17,605 million. This amount represents a decrease
        <strong>of 15,07%</strong> from the previous quarter, and
        <strong>6,45% decrease</strong>
        compared to 2023’s first quarter. However, there was an
        <strong>increase of 18,84%</strong> in the second quarter, which is a
        <strong>rise of 2.93%</strong> compared to the same period last year.
        These increases are influenced by direct costs, such as raw material
        costs, as well as other factors like vehicle recalls, In response to the
        increasing cost of sales, Tesla implemented strategies to mitigate this
        increase.

      <h1>1. Overview of Tesla's Cost of Sales in Q2 2024:</h1>
      <p>
        Tesla's cost of sales represents the direct costs associated with the
        production of its vehicles and energy products. This is a key metric for
        assessing the company's profitability and operational efficiency. Tesla
        aims to have increased revenue with little to no increase in cost of
        sales.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Key Financial Metrics:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Total Revenue:</strong> Tesla reported total revenue of $25.5
          billion in Q2 2024, an increase from $24.927 billion in Q2 2023. This
          growth was driven by higher sales volumes and increased demand for
          Tesla’s products.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of Sales:</strong> The cost of sales for Q2 2024 was
          $20.922 billion, up from $20.394 billion in Q2 2023. This increase
          reflects higher manufacturing costs, supply chain challenges, and the
          ramp-up of new production facilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Tesla’s gross profit for Q2 2024 was
          4.578, up from 4.533 in Q2 2023. The increase in gross profit is
          attributed to the increase in sales and Tesla’s ability to produce in
          house and sell directly to customers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Analysis of Cost Drivers:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Manufacturing Costs:</strong> The rise in manufacturing costs
          is primarily due to the scaling of production, particularly for new
          vehicle models like the “Cybertruck” this as well as the expansion of
          their large gigafactories in Texas and Berlin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supply Chain and Raw Materials:</strong> Supply chain
          disruptions and increased raw material costs, particularly for lithium
          and nickel. These are essential for battery production and have
          therefore has a significantly large impact on the cost of sales of
          Tesla.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technological Investments:</strong> Tesla’s investments in
          automation and advanced manufacturing technologies have led to
          short-term increases in costs but are expected to yield long-term
          efficiency and productivity gains. These costs are expected to
          decrease over the next few financial years.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Comparative Analysis:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Quarter-on-Quarter Comparison:</strong> Comparing Q2 2024 to
          Q2 2023, the cost of sales increased by 2.93%. This reflects Tesla's
          growth strategy and the broader trend of rising costs in the
          automotive industry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Industry Benchmarking:</strong> Tesla’s cost of sales, though
          increased, remains competitive compared to another automaker. This is
          due to their “vertical integration strategy” and in-house production
          capabilities. For example, other EV manufacturers have had very
          similar or even higher increases in costs, this is primarily due to
          global supply chain issues and increased natural resource costs around
          the world.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Strategic Recommendations:</h2>
      <ul>

          sales, Tesla should continue optimizing its production processes. This
          can be achieved by focusing on automation and efficiency in its
          gigafactories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable Sourcing:</strong> Emphasizing sustainable
          sourcing of raw materials will not only align with Tesla’s mission but
          could also lead to more stable and higher quality long-term costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Innovation in Energy Efficiency:</strong> Continued investment
          in research and development for battery technology and energy
          efficiency will help mitigate rising production costs and improve
          gross margins over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recycling opportunities:</strong> Lithium-Ion Batteries have a
          large impact in the world, especially with regards to EV’s. These
          batteries contain strong acids, which if not disposed of correctly can
          have a large negative impact on wildlife and even in humans beings.
